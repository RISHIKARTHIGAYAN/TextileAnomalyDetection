# TextileAnomalyDetection
This github repository contains files pertaining to Textile Anomaly Detection using Images.

Outline of the Project:
  Textile anomaly detection is a critical task in quality control within the textile industry. This project investigates two deep learning approaches—Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) and CNN-based Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD)—for identifying defects in texture and cloth datasets. The CAE model is employed to reconstruct normal samples, enabling the detection of defects through reconstruction errors. In contrast, the Deep SVDD approach maps normal samples into a compact hypersphere in the latent space, where deviations indicate anomalies. Both methods are evaluated on a texture and cloth dataset, highlighting their strengths in detecting subtle and complex defects. This project provides valuable insights into deep learning techniques for textile inspection, assisting in understanding state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods and their industrial applications.
